'''
Optimisers:		Adam Gradient Descent
Loss function:		Cross-Entropy (if my labels are integers use sparse_categorical_crossentropy if they are one-hot encoded use categorical_crossentropy)
Activiation:		ReLU for the hidden layers and softmax for the output layer (to give probability of different classes) or linear function (for regression)
			Leaky ReLU (small negative slope rather than 0) is sometimes used to allow better backpropagation if a certain weight have a too large of a negative weight that causes the node to never fire. Only used if large portion of the nodes are deing, other than that always use ReLU.
			Always end with Softmax (for single lable classifying), because it gives probability between 0 and 1
			Always end with Sigmoid (for multi lable classifying), because it does not give probability between 0 and 1
Neural Networks:	Feed Forward , Recurrent , Convolutional , Unsupervised (GAN)
Layers:			*Input layer:	1 layer , 1 node
			*Hidden layer:	1 - 2 layers (except for convolutional networks). The starting number of nodes can be between the number of nodes in the input later and the number of nodes in the output layer
			*Output layer:	1 layer , nodes = number of classes 

Learning Rate:		The steps taken in Gradient Descent to reach the global minima. low = more accurate but slower. If loss is increasing that means the Learning Rate is high.

Verbose 23 is best to printout the epoch cycle only. The validation split is splitting the dataset into a train/test set (0.25 = 25% for the test set), thus the final accuracy we want to use is the valication accuracy (where it is measured using the test set's preformace on the model)
